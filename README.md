# Misbah Aslam Sirnaik 

I am pursuing a Bachelor Degree in Computer Science and Technology. 
I am an ebullient, enthusiastic, hardworking and an all round effervescent person. I enjoy working with a team. Often, I start out in the background, observing and contributing; 
however, before I even notice, I usually end up as a team leader. Having been a part of Reliance Industries.Ltd  as an Intern I gave my contribution on one of the 
challenging areas of technology entitled - "Big Data And Its File Formats".
