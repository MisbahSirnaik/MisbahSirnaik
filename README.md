however, before I even notice, I usually end up as a team leader. Having been a part of Reliance Industries.Ltd  as an Intern I gave my contribution on one of the

## Team Techy Warriors
This repository contains all code files and data we used in the IBMHC 2020 project for the Sentiment Analysis of COVID-19 Tweets. 
In this project, we utilized twitter data, leveraged NLP techniques to process the text data, analyzed the data by sentiment analysis using TextBlob and IBM Tone Analyzer, visualised the data in Tableau public and developed an android application for best user interaction.

## Overview
A washing machine is basically a machine designed to wash or clean laundries such as towels, clothing, and sheets. Generally, washing machines are powered by electrical energy. This washing machine project aims to design and fabricate a washing machine which uses human energy instead. Mechanical energy is transmitted to the clothes load by the rotation of the agitator or by the whirling action of the drum. In this pedal powered washing machine project, the rotation of the drum or agitator is caused by the rotation motion of the pedals. Pedal power involves transferring power from a human source by means of foot pedals and a crank system.
